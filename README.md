# Pig Game ðŸŽ²

This project is an implementation of the **Pig Game**, a simple and fun dice game for two players. The game is built with **TypeScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**, featuring a responsive UI and dynamic game logic.

## ðŸ“œ Rules of the Game

1. The game is played by 2 players in turns.
2. Each player's goal is to score **100 points** or more before the other player.
3. On a player's turn:
    - The player rolls a dice.
    - The rolled number is added to their **current score**, unless a `1` is rolled.
    - If the player rolls a `1`, their current score resets to `0` and it's the next player's turn.
4. A player can choose to "Hold" their score:
    - The current score is added to their **total score**.
    - It becomes the next player's turn.
5. The first player to reach **100 points** wins the game!
